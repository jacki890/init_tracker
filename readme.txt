This is an initiative tracking program to use with
D&D style games. The main function is for the DM to put PC and
NPC names into a text file, manually enter dice roll numbers
for each character, then output the character's names depending
the initiative rules.

I would eventually like it to include rules from various versions
of D&D and AD&D with the ability to switch between them. I also
plan to include hit point tracking and so forth to make things
a lot easier for the DM to keep track of.
